# CRON

## Intro

The software utility cron is a time-based job shedule in Unix-like computer operation systems.

Users that set up and main software environments use cron to schedule jobs(commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dataes or intervals.

## Overview

Each line of a crontab file represents a job, and looks like this:

```bash
# ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
# │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
# │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
# │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday;
# │ │ │ │ │                                   7 is also Sunday on some systems)
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# * * * * * <command to execute>

#For example, the following clears the Apache error log at one minute past midnight (00:01) every day, assuming that the default shell for the cron user is Bourne shell compliant:

1 0 * * * printf "" > /var/log/apache/error_log
#This example runs a shell program called export_dump.sh at 23:45 (11:45 PM) every Saturday.

45 23 * * 6 /home/oracle/scripts/export_dump.sh

#Note: we can also specify */n to run for every nth interval of time. As well as specify multiple specific time intervals with commas (1,2,3,etc..)The below would output "hello world" to the command line every 5th minute of every first, second and third hour so (0100, 0105, .., 0355).

*/5 1,2,3 * * * echo hello world

```

## Nonstandard predefined scheduling definitions

Some cron implementations[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#cite_note-freebsd-3) support the following non-standard macros:

|Entry                     |Description   | Equivalent to |
| :----------------------: |:-----------------------:               | :-----------: |
| `@yearly (or @annually)` |Run once a year at midnight of 1 January | `0 0 1 1 *`  |
|        `@monthly`        |Run once a month at midnight of the first day of the month |  `0 0 1 * *`  |
|        `@weekly`         |Run once a week at midnight on Sunday morning |  `0 0 * * 0`  |
| `@daily (or @midnight)`  |Run once a day at midnight |  `0 0 * * *`  |
|        `@hourly`         |Run once an hour at the beginning of the hour |  `0 * * * *`  |
|        `@reboot`         |Run at startup |      N/A      |

## CRON expression[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cron&action=edit&section=9)]

A CRON expression is a string comprising five or six fields separated by white space[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#cite_note-11) that represents a set of times, normally as a schedule to execute some routine.

Comments begin with a comment mark #, and must be on a line by themselves.

|     Year     |   No     |    1970-2099    |        `*` `,` `-`         | This field is not supported in standard/default implementations. |

- Comma ( , )
Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using "MON,WED,FRI" in the 5th field (day of week) means Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
- Dash( - )
Dash defines ranges. For example, 2000-2010 indicates every year between 2000 and 2010, inclusive.
